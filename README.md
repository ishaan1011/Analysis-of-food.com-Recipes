# Introduction

The following dataset was downloaded from [food.com](https://www.food.com) as two datasets: one containing receipes and their specific attributes and another with ratings and their reviews of recipes. We merged these datasets into one to be able to answer the following question: is there a relationship between the number of steps in a recipe and the average rating of that recipe?.

The plot above is a scatter plot of n_steps versus average rating (where duplicate `id` rows were dropped as `n_steps` and `average_rating` are the same for the same recipe). From the scatter plot, we can see a general trend where recipes with more steps have a lower proportion of recipes with a low `average_rating` compated to recipes with less steps; this would also convey that recipes with more steps have a higher proportion of recipes with a higher average rating compared to recipes with less steps. This graph, therefore, possibly indicates that--with further analysis needing to prove it--recipes with more steps, on average, are more likely to have a higher average rating.

The pivot table above looks at the distribution of average ratings (grouped together in intervals of 1 to better visualize any possible trends) for each `n_steps` value in the dataframe. This is interesting as it allows one to potentially point out any possible relationship between the two variable to further explore.
