# Introduction

The following dataset was downloaded from [food.com](https://www.food.com) as two datasets: one containing receipes and their specific attributes and another with ratings and their reviews of recipes. We merged these datasets into one to be able to answer the following question: is there a relationship between the number of steps in a recipe and the average rating of that recipe?.
